## Overview

The database schema is designed to organize and store data for the project in a structured manner. It defines the tables and their relationships to efficiently manage and query data. Understanding the schema is crucial for developing applications that interact with the database.

## Schema Structure

The schema consists of several tables that represent different entities and their attributes. Here is an overview of the table structure:


## Table Descriptions

- **table1**: Description of table1.
  - `column1`: Description of column1 in table1.
  - `column2`: Description of column2 in table1.
  ...

- **table2**: Description of table2.
  - `column1`: Description of column1 in table2.
  - `column2`: Description of column2 in table2.
  ...

- **table3**: Description of table3.
  - `column1`: Description of column1 in table3.
  - `column2`: Description of column2 in table3.
  ...

## Relationships

Describe the relationships between the tables in the database schema. For example:

- **table1** has a one-to-many relationship with **table2** based on the `column1` foreign key.
- **table2** has a many-to-many relationship with **table3** through a junction table called **table2_table3**.

Explain the relationships in more detail if necessary.

## Additional Information

Provide any additional information about the database schema that may be relevant. For example:

- Enumerations or constraints used in the schema.
- Indexes or triggers defined on certain tables.
- Any known limitations or considerations when working with the schema.

## License

Specify the license for the database schema if applicable. For example, "This database schema is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE)."
